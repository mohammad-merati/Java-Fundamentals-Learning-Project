Java-Fundamentals-Learning-Project

A structured educational project created to practice the fundamentals of Java programming.
Includes variables, operators, conditionals, loops, arrays, methods, input handling, and basic exception management.

🚀 How to Run the Project

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/mohammad-merati/Java-Fundamentals-Learning-Project.git


Open the project in an IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.

Run any MainApp.java file from:

Gateway01/MainApp.java
Gateway02/MainApp.java

🎯 Purpose of the Project

This repository is part of my Java learning journey and is designed to strengthen the essential skills required for backend and full-stack development.

Each phase introduces new concepts with small practical exercises.

🚦 Phase 1 – Java Basics (Gateway 01)

This phase covers:

Variables

Operators

Conditionals (if / switch)

Loops (for / while / do-while)

Input handling

Basic exception management

Simple debugging practice

📌 This phase focuses on building a solid foundation in Java syntax and logic.

🚦 Phase 2 – Arrays & Methods (Gateway 02)

This phase covers:

One-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays

Methods (void / return)

Passing parameters

Console input handling

Mini Project: Car Service Management System

📌 This phase improves problem-solving with arrays and modular code using functions.

🧩 Notes

This project will continue to grow as I progress in Java.
Next phases will include:

OOP (classes & objects)

File handling

Collections framework

Exception hierarchy

Simple real-world projects
